# Todo List App

This is my simple Todo List app built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase.

## Features
- User authentication (log in and log out).
- Create, edit, and delete tasks.
- Profile page with user details (My detail for the time being).

## Setup

### 1. Download the ZIP file 

### 2. NPM Install
Assuming that all of the tool mentioned above work (I used Tailwind CSS 3.4 seen in Package.json) type NPM install into the terminal the todo-list-app-main terminal

### 3. Check the Firebase.js
If you want to keep the project connected with my google firebase leave it as it is.
